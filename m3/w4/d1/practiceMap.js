/* Imagine you are a Math teacher and you have to grade our students based on their performance on two projects (40% of final grade) and their final exam (60% of final grade). So the whole class is represented as an array of objects (each object contains the data about that student), and we need to get a new array of objects, but this time the objects will contain only student´s name, and their final grade. Let´s do it.*/
